This is a service part of Click to Call app .


This was to notify or send messages to users and services . This is built using FastAPI : https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/


This sends emails to every action that needs the user notified , other services will find this app via the service name in the services networks dns used across .

this would not be a great idea to us it to notify mobile clients as much  . but its due for a review on the mechanisms and deployment .
